# CS4300-Project1
Language: Java 8  
IDE: Eclipse  
An artificial intelligence project to solve the classic puzzle Missionaries &amp; Cannibals. See project's README file for a description of the project, an overview of the file structure and the occasional comment about implementation. 

This compiles with several generic type errors due to my attempts to implement the logic as loosely connected to the Cannibal class as possible. Any comments that will assist in resolving these warnings would be appreciated. I am unable to simply provide a type as it causes compilation errors instead.
